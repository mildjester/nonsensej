		<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I usually work as a scrum master in scrum development.</p>
<p>I have the developers estimate in story points.<br>
Story points are not estimated in “man-hours”, but instead in “difficulty” or “effort”.</p>
<p>However, members were having trouble with this expression because it was so fluffy.<br>
Different members have different interpretations, and although we don&rsquo;t estimate in man-hours to begin with, we sometimes determine which tickets can be implemented in a sprint based on story points,<br>
In the end, everyone was thinking in terms of relative man-hours for each ticket, and it was very agonizing.</p>
<p>At that time, I had a chance to attend a Scrum training by Scrum coaches, which was a good opportunity for me to ask them about the concept of estimation.<br>
As a result, I was able to come up with an interpretation that really clicked with me, so I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<h2 id="estimating-approach">Estimating Approach</h2>
<p>From the results, it seems that it is not wrong to consider the “relative man-hours for each ticket.<br>
However, there are assumptions to be made, and if they are mistaken, a correct estimate cannot be made.</p>
<h3 id="assumption-1-if-i-did-it-not">Assumption #1: If I did it. Not.</h3>
<img src="http://localhost:1313/images/2024/story-point-knowledge-001.png" style="width:300px;"/>  
<p>The following is a line I often hear when I am estimating and ask for a basis for points.</p>
<ul>
<li>This response requires adjustment with CSS, but I put it high because I am not good at adjusting styles.</li>
<li>I have never been involved in this function, so I put it high because I start with an investigation of the affected area.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above approach is not acceptable.<br>
You need to think objectively and put points in terms of “what kind of work is involved” and “how heavy is each task in general?<br>
Establish a standard within the team, such as “if it were done by an average-level person who is usually in charge of this task.<br>
Also, if you do not know what kind of work is required for a task, you should get a rough idea of the work from an expert before putting in points.</p>
<p>Even after doing this, there will still be discrepancies in the “weight of the work,” so it would be good if you could just reconcile that at the end of the process.<br>
If you feel that there is a discrepancy with others, you can make use of the results from the next estimate.</p>
<h3 id="assumption-2-think-of-man-hours-not-in-terms-of-specific-numbers-but-in-terms-of-which-one-is-likely-to-take-longer">Assumption 2: Think of man-hours not in terms of specific numbers, but in terms of which one is likely to take longer.</h3>
<img src="http://localhost:1313/images/2024/story-point-knowledge-002.png" style="width:300px;"/>  
<p>Although we said that we would point to the relative number of man-hours, when considering how long this work is likely to take, we should not think in terms of specifics, such as “it is likely to take 3 days, so it is equivalent to 3P.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that people grow, so a task that takes three days now may be done in one day a year from now.<br>
If you use a specific number to estimate the work, the points for the exact same task will change three times between now and one year from now, resulting in a discrepancy between the same task but different points.</p>
<p>If we use a relative sense rather than a specific figure, the points will not be significantly different one year from now.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisite-3-if-you-dont-know-better-dont-put-in-points">Prerequisite 3: If you don&rsquo;t know better, don&rsquo;t put in points.</h3>
<img src="http://localhost:1313/images/2024/story-point-knowledge-003.png" style="width:300px;"/>  
<p>This may be a prerequisite or a caveat to the estimate.</p>
<p>As mentioned briefly in Prerequisite 1), it is normal for a person to say, “I have never been involved in this function,” in response to an estimation task.<br>
We will discuss what kind of work is involved before the point estimate, but if you still have no idea what the task is, you need to have the courage not to participate in the estimate.<br>
I think that even with the web planning poker tool, there is a “? in the web planning poker tool, but that is it.</p>
<p>Forcing points into a function when you don&rsquo;t know the amount of work involved will only result in noise, so don&rsquo;t just read the air and say you&rsquo;ll put in points that seem to fit with others.<br>
However, don&rsquo;t give up and say that you don&rsquo;t need to estimate the relevant function in the future, but make an effort to be able to participate next time by looking at what points were awarded.</p>
<h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2>
<p>I made a lot of assumptions, but I found it difficult to convey this in one word.<br>
I think the expressions that came out as a result are “degree of difficulty” and “effort.</p>
<p>Also, an estimate is only a guideline for the work to be done and does not provide value to the customer.<br>
If you spend too many man-hours to make a better estimate and as a result spend less man-hours on the value you can provide to the customer, you are missing the point.<br>
Since the optimal operation will differ from team to team, each team should find its own realistic estimation method.<br>
I think it is the job of the Scrum Master to facilitate this process.</p>
