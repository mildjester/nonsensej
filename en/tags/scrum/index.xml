      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I usually work as a scrum master in scrum development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have the developers estimate in story points.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Story points are not estimated in “man-hours”, but instead in “difficulty” or “effort”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, members were having trouble with this expression because it was so fluffy.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Different members have different interpretations, and although we don&amp;rsquo;t estimate in man-hours to begin with, we sometimes determine which tickets can be implemented in a sprint based on story points,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In the end, everyone was thinking in terms of relative man-hours for each ticket, and it was very agonizing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
